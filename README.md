Linking the GitHub account with Local Repository 



Pushing project To GitHub:
1. git add filename
// this will add the files to the staging are
2. git commit -m "Commit Message"
3. git push 
// push the file from local repo to github server



.gitignore file:
- This will make git ignore the files defined here
- Many files like os files, directories, dependencies that can be downloaded from package
  manager can be put here.
  - To use:
    Create .gitignore file
    1) for directory :
        directory_name/
